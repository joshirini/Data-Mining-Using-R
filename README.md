# dataMiningUsingR-Voter-Preference
The data in the accompanying file “VoterPref.csv” contains data from a survey of random sample of registered voters in a state. The subjects were asked whether they were “For” or “Against” a proposal on the ballot to increase the state sales tax by 0.5%, with the stipulation that the additional tax revenues be spent on education. In addition to their position on the proposition, some additional demographic information is collected. The variables in the data set are:

PREFERENCE		 “For” or “Against”
AGE			Years of age at time of survey
INCOME		Annual income in thousands of US dollars
GENDER		“M” or “F”

The intent of the survey is to develop a strategy to target individuals for a marketing campaign designed to “get out the vote”.
